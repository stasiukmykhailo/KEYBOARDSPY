# KEYBOARD SPY

## Description

Keyboard spy is used to track which keys were pressed on the remote computer. The mechanism "WinHook" was used in this project to make it look like a virus and hide from the "victim's" eyes. 
**WARNING!** The author in no way recommends using this program for hacking or espionage. This project was created only as a pet-project for author's small portfolio.

## How to start spying

##### STEP1
On the computer, you want to use as a **spy**, open the program **"LISTENER CONSOLE LOG"**.
##### STEP2
In the **"PORT BOX"** write your Internet **port** of the computer, you use. The **IP** will be automatically shown in the IP box.
##### STEP3
Press the button **"CREATE POINT"**. The local receiving point will be created. The console is now functionable.
##### STEP4
On the computer, you want to use as a **victim**, open the program **"WINHOOK"**.
##### STEP5
In the open window write the **IP** and the **PORT** of the computer, to whom you want to send data. **TIP:** You need to use the same IP and the PORT as on the **"spy computer"**.
##### STEP6
Press the **"SPY"** button. **NOW YOUR COMPUTER SENDS INFORMATION OF PRESSED KEYS TO THE SPY.**

## Logic
The spy creates the "local receiving point" where data comes from other computers. Immediately, as the user pressed the "create point" button, the computer starts to react and begins "grabbing" data, that was sent to him. To stop receiving data just close the program.
Speaking about the "victim" computer, after you pressed the "Spy this computer" button, information of each key, the user has pressed, will be "tracked" and sent to the spy. In order for the victim not to notice these actions, the program will not be displayed on the taskbar, it will be visible only in the task manager.
**AS MENTIONED HIGHER:** The author in no way recommends using this program for hacking or espionage. This project was created only as a pet-project for authorâ€™s small portfolio.
